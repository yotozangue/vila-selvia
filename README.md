## Project Introduction

This is the final project for the Web Programming course where we built a website for natural lodges called "Vila Selva". The website was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap technologies. The goal of the project was to provide users with an intuitive platform for booking their stays in lodges located in lush natural environments. The website design was crafted to highlight the beauty of nature and offer a user-friendly and easy-to-navigate experience.
